* Lorenz synthetic time series data
This package contains modules for generating synthetic time series data using the Lorenz system.

** Installation
Install the package by running 'python setup.py develop'. This will install the package in development mode, linking to
this directory instead of copying the files to your python distribution.

** Storage format
The data is stored in HDF5 files. Each hyper parameter setting of the Lorenz system is collected in its own group in
the HDF5 root. In the hyper parameter group, there's a second level of groups which gathers datasets that share ODE
solver settings, such as time resolution, time to skip and random number seed. In this group there are two datasets,
one with the original data generated by the ODE solver with the given settings, and one is the data projected on
canonical principal components. The projection matrix is ordered by the magnitude of the eigenvalues, so the leading
dimension correspond to the leading principal component.

** Usage
To generate data, run 'bin/generate_lorenz_data.py N', where N is the number of trajectories to generate. By default,
the data is created in the HDF5 file 'data/lorenz.h5'.

To use the data, the class Dataset in lorenz/dataset.py provides convenience functions.
